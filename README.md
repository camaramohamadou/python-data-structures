# Python Data Structures

This repository provides a simple reference for Python data structures, including lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets. It includes examples and basic operations for each data structure, aimed at helping you revise and understand their usage.

## Lists
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.

### Example
```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, '3', True]

# Getting the length of the list
print(len(my_list))  # Output: 4

# Finding the index of an element
print(my_list.index('3'))  # Output: 2

# Counting occurrences of an element
print(my_list.count(2))  # Output: 1
